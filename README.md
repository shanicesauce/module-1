# Horiseon 
As a first assignment I was asked to refactor the coding to ensure the webpage is user friendly on all devices while the coding is clean, easily read and looks like the end goal we were provided with.

# What was done
Studying the html, there were many div tags that could have had a different semantic tag which worked with the coding. Restructuring the tags, I needed to ensure anything I changed in html matched the coding in css of the page. Changing things slowly to ensure I match the correct semantics with the correct style to ensure the webpage continues to look pretty and organised.
